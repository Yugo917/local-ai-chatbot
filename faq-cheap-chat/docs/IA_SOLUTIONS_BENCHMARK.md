### Additional Details:

1. **Rasa**:
   - **Language**: Python for core scripts and customizations (e.g., model training or API integration).
   - **Associated Frameworks**: TensorFlow, spaCy.

2. **Haystack**:
   - **Language**: Python.
   - **Associated Frameworks**: Transformers (by Hugging Face), Elasticsearch/OpenSearch for semantic search.

3. **BotPress**:
   - **Language**: Node.js (JavaScript/TypeScript).
   - **Specifics**: JavaScript development skills are required for advanced customizations.

4. **LangChain with local LLM**:
   - **Primary Languages**: Python (for most NLP workflows) and JavaScript (for front-end or Node.js server integration).
   - **Associated Frameworks**: Hugging Face, PyTorch/Transformers for models, external APIs like GPT.

5. **Flowise**:
   - **No coding required** for the user (drag-and-drop interface).
   - Backend uses **LangChain**, which is implemented in Python for underlying workflows.

This breakdown helps you choose based on your teamâ€™s expertise and the languages they are comfortable with. If you need guidance on starting with any of these solutions, I can provide concrete examples or further details!
